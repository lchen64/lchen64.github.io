** Website Still Under Construction**

I am a Machine Learning PhD student at [KAIST](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/) with a background in statistical learning, information theory, and optimization. My general research interests are in image processing, statistical signal processing, and computer vision. 

Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with Honors, majoring in [Mathematics](https://math.berkeley.edu/) and [Computer Science https://eecs.berkeley.edu], where I had the pleasure of being advised by Prof Bruno Olshausen and Prof Jack Gallant in the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) in my undergraduate research. There, I worked at the intersection of theoretical visual neuroscience and unsupervised learning for computer vision.

Besides my research interests, I'm also interested in computational geometry, functional analysis, and differential geometry.

In my free time, I like to cook: recently I've been into Italian. Also, I play the violin as a hobby. 

If you're interested in what I do, feel free to email me and schedule a chat.
