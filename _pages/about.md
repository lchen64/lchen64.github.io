Thanks for stopping by my webpage!

I'm a Mathematics PhD Student at Michigan State University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Guowei Wei](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/weig/) and [Arun Ross](https://rossarun.wixsite.com/arun-ross).

Previously, I completed my Masters in Mathematical Sciences at [KAIST](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/en/), where I was very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Wooseok Ha](https://haywse.github.io/) and Professor [Youngjoon Hong](https://www.youngjoonhong.com/publication), and to have my research supported by the KAIST Presidential Graduate Fellowship. 

Before that, I graduated from UC Berkeley with High Honors, and double majors from the [Mathematics Department](https://math.berkeley.edu/) and [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), where I had the pleasure of being advised by [Bruno Olshausen](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/people/bruno-olshausen/) and [Jack Gallant](https://gallantlab.org/) in the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/). There I worked on research in theoretical visual neuroscience and unsupervised learning methods for computer vision. I was also an undergrad research intern at [UC Irvine](https://engineering.uci.edu/dept/eecs).

Recently I've been working on improving the theoretical foundations of diffusion models, focusing on sampling efficiency. Also, I've been exploring approaches from graph representation learning and diffusion, in order to generate scalable neural network architectures/parameters. 

Research Interests:
=====================

* Diffusion Models (particularly on Non-Euclidean Geometries)
* High-Dimensional Statistics, Machine Learning Theory
* Geometry Processing, Topological Data Analysis
* Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Analysis of Optimization Algorithms
* Image and Video Processing
  
Besides my research interests, I also find applications of functional analysis to machine learning interesting. I also enjoying teaching math and computer science concepts, and have been a TA for a few courses at KAIST and UC Berkeley.

In my free time (which is kind of nonexistent) my hobbies are swimming and cooking. Recently I've been into Italian recipes! 

If you're interested in what I'm doing and want to chat, you're welcome to email me!
