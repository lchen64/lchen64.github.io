I am a first-year PhD student at [KAIST](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/) with a background in statistical learning, information theory, and optimization. My general research interests are in image processing/computer vision, statistical signal processing, and automated machine learning. 

Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with Honors, majoring in [Mathematics](https://math.berkeley.edu/) and [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), where I had the pleasure of being advised by [Prof Bruno Olshausen](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/people/bruno-olshausen/) and [Prof Jack Gallant](https://gallantlab.org/) in the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) in my undergraduate research. There, I worked on theoretical visual neuroscience and on unsupervised learning methods for computer vision.

I also worked as a machine learning engineer in Silicon Valley before beginning my PhD, where I learned a lot about how to deploy ML models in production software, and how to engineer scalable data pipelines.

Besides my main research interests, I'm also interested in computational geometry, functional analysis, and differential geometry. I enjoy teaching others about what I've learned and was previously a TA at Berkeley.

In my free time, I like to cook: recently I've been into Italian. Also, I play the violin as a hobby. 

If you're interested in what I do, feel free to email me and I'd be happy to schedule a chat.
