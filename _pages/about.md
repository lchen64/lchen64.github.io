** Website Still Under Construction**

I am a Machine Learning PhD student at KAIST with a background in statistical learning, information theory, and optimization. My general research interests are in image processing, statistical signal processing, and computer vision. 

Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with Honors, majoring in Mathematics, Computer Science, where I had the pleasure of being advised by Prof Bruno Olshausen and Prof Jack Gallant in the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab in my undergraduate research.

Besides my research interests, I'm also interested in computational geometry, functional analysis, and differential geometry.

In my free time, I like to cook (recently I've been into Italian food), and I play the violin as a hobby. 

If you're interested in what I do, feel free to email me and schedule a chat.
