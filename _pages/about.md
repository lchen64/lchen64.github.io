Thanks for stopping by my webpage!

I'm a final semester Math Master's Student at [KAIST](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/en/), where I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Wooseok Ha](https://haywse.github.io/) and [Youngjoon Hong](https://www.youngjoonhong.com/publication), and to have my research supported by the KAIST Presidential PhD Fellowship. Recently I've been working on improving the theoretical foundations of diffusion models, focusing on sampling efficiency. Also, I've been exploring approaches from graph representation learning and diffusion, in order to generate scalable neural network architectures/parameters. 
  

Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with High Honors, and majors from the [Mathematics Department](https://math.berkeley.edu/) and [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), where I had the pleasure of being advised by [Bruno Olshausen](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/people/bruno-olshausen/) and [Jack Gallant](https://gallantlab.org/) in the [Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/). There I worked on research in theoretical visual neuroscience and unsupervised learning methods for computer vision. I was also an undergrad research intern at [UC Irvine](https://engineering.uci.edu/dept/eecs).

Before beginning graduate school, I worked as a machine learning engineer, where I gained experience about how to deploy machine learning models in production-quality software, and how to engineer scalable data pipelines.

Research Interests:
=====================

* Diffusion Models, Particularly on Non-Euclidean Geometries
* High-Dimensional Statistics, Domain Adaptation
* Geometry Processing, Topological Data Analysis
* Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Analysis of Optimization Algorithms
* Image and Video Processing
  
Besides my research interests, I also find applications of functional analysis to machine learning interesting. I also enjoying teaching math and computer science concepts, and have been a TA for a few courses at KAIST and UC Berkeley.

In my free time (which is kind of nonexistent, haha) my hobbies are swimming and cooking. Recently I've been into Italian recipes! 

If you're interested in what I'm doing and want to chat, you're welcome to email me!
